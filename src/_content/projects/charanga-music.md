I worked with Charanga Music to craft a versatile front-end boilerplate / component library, ensuring reusability, extensibility, responsiveness, and accessibility.

This streamlined their ability to swiftly develop and deploy future web offerings, maintaining top-notch front-end standards throughout the process.
