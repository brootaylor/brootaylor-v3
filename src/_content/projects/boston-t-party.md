Developed a high speed PWA website tailored for Boston T Party, emphasising performance and resilience through progressive enhancement and offline caching techniques.

Ease of use, access, performance, and resilience were particularly crucial considering the limited connectivity, data and bandwidth availability in South Africa.

  We started our small hospitality business in 2009, with little or no direction on how to create and manage a website. Bruce came to the rescue by providing a user-friendly and informative site â€“ numerous guests have commented as to the ease in which they were able to navigate the Boston T Party website.

  Bruce has provided constant updates, always suggesting new and innovative ways to improve the design or content of the site in line with the ever changing needs of our guests/travellers and technology.

  Any issues are dealt with timeously, with great attention to detail. We are extremely happy to continue to work with Bruce and engage with his professional and friendly service.
