Developed a high speed PWA website tailored for Boston T Party, emphasising performance and resilience through progressive enhancement and offline caching techniques.

Performance and resilience where particularly crucial considering the limited connectivity, data and bandwidth availability in South Africa.

The website can be viewed at [bostontparty.co.za](https://bostontparty.co.za/){rel=external}
