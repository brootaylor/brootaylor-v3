This particular project turned out to be one of the enjoyable ones. A lot of this had to do with Analog Implant Laboratory's open-handed and open-hearted involvement in the whole design and development process.

I approached the design and development with 'Mobile First' in mind and built it responsively &ndash; *(small screen upwards)* &ndash; to work on as many screens and devices as possible. It's [progressively enhanced](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement) and makes substantial use of WCAG.

It goes without saying, I wasn't able to test the website on all device types and screen sizes but I tried my best to ensure it's built in a [device-agnostic](http://trentwalton.com/2014/03/10/device-agnostic/) manner.
