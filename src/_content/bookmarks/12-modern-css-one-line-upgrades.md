I'm slapping myself on my wrist for not visiting [moderncss.dev](https://moderncss.dev/) more often. Stephanie Eckles is a legend when it comes to the world of CSS and I reckon it's almost an ***actual*** sin not referencing her work more often. 😳

If you've not come across Stephanie's work before, [12 Modern CSS One-Line Upgrades](https://moderncss.dev/12-modern-css-one-line-upgrades/) is a great place to start.

For example:

> Have you ever used the “[padding hack](https://css-tricks.com/aspect-ratio-boxes/)” to force an aspect ratio such as 16:9 for video embeds? As of September 2021, the `aspect-ratio` property is stable in evergreen browsers and is the only property needed to define an aspect ratio.
>
> For an HD video, you can just use `aspect-ratio: 16/9`. For a perfect square, only `aspect-ratio: 1` is required since the implied second value is also `1`.
