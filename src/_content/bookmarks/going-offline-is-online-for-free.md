Jeremy has very kindly released his book [Going Offline](https://goingoffline.adactio.com/), *online*, for free.

It was first published by A Book Apart in 2018 &mdash; and is a real gem if you're keen to make your websites work offline.

  Jeremy’s technical writing is as superb as always. Similar to his first book for A Book Apart, which cleared up all my confusions about HTML5, Going Offline helps me put the pieces of the service workers’ puzzle together.
