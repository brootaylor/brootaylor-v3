The whole article's worth reading &mdash; but this ðŸ˜±...

> **Data center growth is explosive**. Between now and 2026, itâ€™s predicted this growth could add a Germanyâ€™s worth of electricity demand, not to mention a daily increase of hundreds of millions of gallons of water. Why? To store junk. To cool AI. Itâ€™s one thing for humans to destroy our environment because we need to eat and drink. To destroy our environment so that AI and data junk can feed and drink is an environmental crime. Big Tech profits as waste grows. The more data waste, the greater the profit to the data centers. We can do something by deleting our crap data.
