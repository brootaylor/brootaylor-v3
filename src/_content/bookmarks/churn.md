Oh I like this very much indeed. Another good ol' nudge for me to get more acquainted with [Web Components](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/web-components-will-outlive-your-javascript-framework/).

> [...] WC lifecycles are crazy simple: you register the component with `customElements.define` and it’s off to the races. Just write a class and the browser will take care of elements appearing and disappearing for you, regardless of whether they came from a full reload, a fetch request, or—god forbid—a `document.write`. The syntax looks great in markup, too: no more having to decorate with `js-something` classes or data attributes, you just wrap your shit in a custom element called `something-controller` and everyone can see what you’re up to. Since I’m firmly in camp “progressively enhance or go home” this fits me like a glove, and I also have great hopes for Web Components improving the poor state of pulling in epic dependencies like date pickers or text editors.
