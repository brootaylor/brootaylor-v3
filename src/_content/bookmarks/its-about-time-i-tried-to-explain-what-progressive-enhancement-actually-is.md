What a spot on reminder by Andy.

> Progressive enhancement is a design and development principle where we build in layers which automatically turn themselves on based on the browser’s capabilities. Enhancement layers are treated as off by default, resulting in a solid baseline experience that is designed to work for everyone.
>
> [...] The idea of progressive enhancement is that **everyone gets the perfect experience for them**, rather than a pre-determined “perfect” experience from a design and development team. It’s a perfect experience for users because everything works, which is far from the truth — in reality — with so-called “graceful degradation”.
