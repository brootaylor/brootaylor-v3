I've largely been a fan of Apple over the years, but this decision to limit the capabilities of PWAs on iOS pisses me off.

I'm piggybacking off Remy's call to fight this, which is why this is a bookmark. If you happen to come across this post, please consider joining the *fight* and **[sign the open letter to Tim Cook](https://letter.open-web-advocacy.org/)**.
