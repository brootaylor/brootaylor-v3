A huge amount to ponder on in [this article by Rachel Donald](https://www.planetcritical.com/p/growing-an-economy-of-death).

> The complexity of the global human economy has destroyed the complexity of local natural systems, simplifying and reducing them to economic purpose. If reality is relational then simplification is a domination of reality, negating the potential of the multitudinous set of relationships that exist. (Think of how the dance of beings evolving together is reduced to a monotheistic sky-bloke creating the world in seven days.) Complex human cultures simplify the natural world around them whereas simpler human cultures allow for a more complex and rich natural world; human beings who see themselves as part of the natural world have no need to dominate reality for it is already ordered.
