> Can you ship AI-generated code without creating a maintenance nightmare six months from now? Can you debug it when it breaks? Can you modify it when requirements change? Can you onboard new engineers to a codebase they didn't write and the AI barely explained?
>
> Most teams haven't realized this shift yet. They're optimizing for code generation speed while comprehension debt silently accumulates in their repos.

> One team I talked to spent 3 days fixing what should have been a 2-hour problem. They had "saved" time by having AI generate the initial implementation. But when it broke, they lost 70 hours trying to understand code they had never built themselves.
>
> That's comprehension debt compounding. The time you save upfront gets charged back with interest later.
