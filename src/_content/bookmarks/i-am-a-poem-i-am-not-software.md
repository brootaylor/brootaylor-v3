A wonderful reminder from Robin not to try to be palatable to everyone on the web.

It's a well worn path that many of us end up going down at some point, trying to make our personal websites more 'professional' or 'acceptable' to a wider audience. But in doing so we often lose the very thing that makes our personal websites special and unique.

> A personal website sits on the blurry line between a corporate entity and a skate park. Because a personal website has everything in its future; career connections and maybe weirdo web friends out there, potential ad money to be squeezed out of it or analytics to be siphoned. These constraints and incentives push our websites to be reserved or fabulous and there’s really no right answer here since a personal website can be anything we want it to be.
