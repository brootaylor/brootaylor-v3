This article by Keith is spot on.

I get it that it's probably worth learning *enough* React to maybe land a gig, or to be useful in a context that has already chosen this as its web solution. I have.

But... try not reach for it as some sort of default solution &mdash; no matter what you're building. All too often this ends up stunting a web developer's skills in the long run.

If you're at the beginning of your web development career, I recommend **not** putting all your eggs in the React basket. There's so much else that's *worth* investing your time in learning.

> React proponents might claim that React will teach you modern UI, but from what I've seen it barely copes with modern UI. `autofocus` is broken, custom elements don't work in all but the experimental version, using any "modern" features like `<dialog>` or popovers requires `useEffect`, and the synthetic event system teaches you so little about how DOM actually works. This isn't modern UI, it's UI from 2013 at its inception. I don't have the time left in my career to pick up UI paradigms that haven't evolved much beyond from when Barack Obama was in office.

> When I mentor early career developers and they ask me what they should learn, I can't say React, they don't have time. I mean sure, pick up enough React to land you the inevitable job doing it, but it's not going to level up your career.
