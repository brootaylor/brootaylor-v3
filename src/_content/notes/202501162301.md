We keep hearing about this [£22bn 'black hole'](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2e12j4gz0o) in our nation's finances that needs to be filled... and that they'll need to make "tough choices", like [tax changes](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx25w7qpr0yo), to help claw this back.

But we somehow seem to ***still*** have enough money to [send heaps of it elsewhere](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-support-to-ukraine-factsheet/uk-support-to-ukraine-factsheet). Like £12.8 billion.

I mean... WTF?!
