Beyond the often one-sided Western narrative about Russian aggression in Ukraine and the risks it poses to global security, Mark Carney’s speech felt like a marker of sorts &mdash; one we may look back on as signalling a significant shift in global geopolitics.

Perhaps the end of the unipolar world order dominated by the West, particularly the US, and the beginning of something new: a multipolar world where power is more evenly distributed among several nations.

I guess time will tell.
