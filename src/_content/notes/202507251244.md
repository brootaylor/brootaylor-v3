  Of Ai I think we should ask: To what 'problem' is Ai the solution? And, with many instances of Ai, the answer is far from clear.

  Now, a default answer to that question, as [you] pointed out, citing some of the techno optimists and enthusiasts, is efficiency. But, the ultimate efficiency to the point where we can replace work. But why is replacing work taken to be, without argument or reflection, a good thing?

  We need to have a public debate about what should be the purpose of a new technology. What purpose should Ai serve.
