  We cannot be part of a discussion on <strong>what</strong> risks a certain technology has without asking <strong>whose</strong> risks. It makes an awful lot of difference. Assume you are talking about video display terminals, for example; the great discussion is “Are they or are they not putting the operator’s health or eyes at risk?” You don’t discuss whether there are risks; you discuss whose risks. Who is it that is at risk It’s quite pointless to talk about risk-benefit without saying, “Are those who are at risk also getting the benefits, or are those who are getting the benefits very far removed from risk?”

  […] The questions to ask are “Whose benefits? Whose risks?” rather than “What benefits? What risks?”
