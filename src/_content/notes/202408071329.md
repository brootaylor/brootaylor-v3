Just leaving this here.

  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, C#, and SQL may all be code, but they’re really quite different kinds of code and are suited to different kinds of people.

  [...] I recently worked with an organization where there were dozens of Full Stack Developers and no Frontend Developers. We had a website to build and nobody understood Flexbox, except me. Of course I was happy to help, but I had to learn React on the job to put the work in place. Fortunately I picked it up quite quickly, but the next CSS expert may not have done. The value you want from a CSS expert is their CSS, not their JavaScript, so it’s absurd to make JavaScript a requirement.
