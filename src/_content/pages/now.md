## Reflecting

I think a lot about the effects of "[Overshoot](https://howtosavetheworld.ca/2021/09/21/overshoot-where-we-stand-now-guest-post-by-michael-dowd/)" &mdash; (one of these being "*climate* change") &mdash; and am trying my best to process what I've been researching for the past few years. I most certainly am in the midst of a 'dance' with grief, anger, guilt, confusion, fear, numbness, acceptance, and fleeting moments of&hellip; peace.

[I wrote a post](/writing/2023-05-31/the-climate-crisis-what-to-make-of-it) just over a year ago to at least begin recording my thoughts &mdash; as well as the sources I've been referencing.
