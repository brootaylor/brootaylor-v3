## Plans

My family and and I are hoping to get back to South Africa sometime in 2025. I still have family who live out there and it's been far too long since we've seen them.

## Reflecting

I think a lot about some of the effects of "[Overshoot](https://howtosavetheworld.ca/2021/09/21/overshoot-where-we-stand-now-guest-post-by-michael-dowd/)" &mdash; (for example, "*climate change*" and "*societal breakdown/collapse*") &mdash; and am trying my best to process what I've been researching for the past few years. I most certainly am in the midst of a 'dance' with grief, anger, guilt, confusion, fear, numbness, acceptance, and fleeting moments of&hellip; peace.

[I wrote a post](/writing/2023-05-31/the-climate-crisis-what-to-make-of-it) just over a year ago to at least begin recording my thoughts &mdash; as well as the sources I've been referencing.

I'm also concerned about (and paying attention to) the [geopolitical events playing out in our world](https://theduran.com/orwells-warning-the-insidious-nature-of-political-language-the-cargo-cult-of-woke-christian-parenti-doublespeak-doublethink-history-has-stopped-party-is-always-right/) at the moment. I'm not a '*doomster*' per se but I am a realist, and prefer not to put my head in the sand if I can help it.

It irritated me as a kid when my dad often used to say...

> Observe... observe... observe.

I get it now.
