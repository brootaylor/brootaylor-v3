## Work

I'm working, on a contract basis, as a **Frontend Engineer** for [Admiral Group Plc](/projects/admiral) on their [customer facing websites](/projects/admiral). It honestly has turned out to be a fab experience working with a great team of people. Some of them I would call good friends now.

This contract is due to finish at the **end of December 2025**. I'm considering finding something a bit more '*permanent*' after that. {.call-out}

## Listening <span class="visually-hidden">to this</span> <i aria-hidden="true">&rarr;</i> *Music*

I have a wide taste in music and listen to a lot of different genres &mdash; from classical to metal. I'm a sucker for a strong melody though which is why I often find myself listening to country.

Sleep Token's new album, "[Even in Arcadia](https://open.spotify.com/album/1lS7FeRcSUuIGqyg99UGpj?si=NTCUWee_SwW_yjOaVr5zNg)", dropped a few months ago and I'm still totally hooked. Absolutely gorgeous production.

Charles Kelley's new album, "[Songs For A New Moon](https://open.spotify.com/album/0phabaUgbo3UiTmX78Tqcx?si=cOIrJW8JS3SL-dF7BpwaSg)", puts a smile on my face everytime I listen to it. Melody-tastic country music at its finest.

## Listening <span class="visually-hidden">to these</span> <i aria-hidden="true">&rarr;</i> *Podcasts*

I've been listening to a few podcasts lately. I've listed the ones I find myself returning to the most at the moment.

While I don't necessarily agree with everything that's said in many of the episodes I've listened to &mdash; there are some gems if you're prepared to look for them and keep an open mind.

* [The Great Simplification with Nate Hagens](https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZFJIjuJwh3XeMqrguiXNR?si=21485f0d963344fe) &mdash; *Exploring how energy, the environment, economics, human behavior, and systems science underpin the human predicament.*

## Watching

Seems to be a bit of a challenge finding something worth watching on TV these days. There's a fair amount of *'slop'* out there that's for sure. That, or I'm way too picky.

Then there are a few shows I started watching but ended up getting bored or frustrated with the plot and stopped watching. Oh well... 1st world *problems* eh!

Just finished the 3<sup>rd</sup> season of [Squid Game](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10919420/). Still not sure what to make of the ending. ðŸ¤”

## Plans

My family and I finally got back to South Africa again in July *(for 3 weeks)* and it turned out to be a special time seeing dear family and friends again after so long.

I'm hoping to get back into drumming this year. I miss it desperately and it's been far too long since I've played. There's a fab music studio nearby called [The Hive Rooms](https://www.thehiverooms.com) that I reckon I'll be checking out soon.

## Reflecting

I think a lot about some of the effects of "[Overshoot](https://howtosavetheworld.ca/2021/09/21/overshoot-where-we-stand-now-guest-post-by-michael-dowd/)" &mdash; (for example, "*climate change*" and "*societal breakdown/collapse*") &mdash; and am trying my best to process what I've been researching for the past few years. I most certainly am in the midst of a 'dance' with grief, anger, guilt, confusion, fear, numbness, acceptance, and fleeting moments of&hellip; peace.

[I wrote a post](/writing/2023-05-31/the-climate-crisis-what-to-make-of-it) just over a year ago to at least begin recording my thoughts &mdash; as well as the sources I've been referencing.

I'm also concerned about (and paying attention to) the [geopolitical events playing out in our world](https://theduran.com/orwells-warning-the-insidious-nature-of-political-language-the-cargo-cult-of-woke-christian-parenti-doublespeak-doublethink-history-has-stopped-party-is-always-right/) at the moment. I'm not a '*doomster*' per se but I am a realist, and prefer not to put my head in the sand if I can help it.

It irritated me as a kid when my dad often used to say...

> Observe... observe... observe.

I get it now.
