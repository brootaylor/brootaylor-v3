## Listening <span class="visually-hidden">to this</span> <i aria-hidden="true">&rarr;</i> *Music*

I have a wide taste in music and listen to a lot of different genres &mdash; from classical to metal. I'm a sucker for a strong melody though which is why I often find myself listening to country.

Sleep Token's new album, "[Even in Arcadia](https://open.spotify.com/album/1lS7FeRcSUuIGqyg99UGpj?si=NTCUWee_SwW_yjOaVr5zNg)" dropped today &mdash; *09/05/2025* &mdash; and I'm already hooked. Absolutely gorgeous.

## Listening <span class="visually-hidden">to these</span> <i aria-hidden="true">&rarr;</i> *Podcasts*

I've been listening to a few podcasts lately. I've listed the ones I find myself returning to the most at the moment.

While I don't necessarily agree with everything that's said in many of the episodes I've listened to &mdash; there are some gems if you're prepared to look for them and keep an open mind.

## Watching

Seems to be a bit of a challenge finding something worth watching on TV these days. There's a fair amount of *'slop'* out there that's for sure. That, or I'm way too picky.

Then there are a few shows I started watching but ended up getting bored or frustrated with the plot and stopped watching. Oh well... 1st world *problems* eh!

Saying that, I did come across the [MobLand](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31510819/) series recently by Guy Ritchie and have been enjoying it. Also noticed that the second season of [The Last of Us](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3581920/) is out now. The first season was fab so fingers-crossed the second season is a goodie as well.

## Plans

My family and I are heading back to South Africa this year for a few weeks. I still have family who live out there and it's been far too long since we've seen them.

I'm hoping to get back into drumming this year. I miss it desperately and it's been far too long since I've played. There's a fab music studio nearby called [The Hive Rooms](https://www.thehiverooms.com) that I reckon I'll be checking out soon.

## Reflecting

I think a lot about some of the effects of "[Overshoot](https://howtosavetheworld.ca/2021/09/21/overshoot-where-we-stand-now-guest-post-by-michael-dowd/)" &mdash; (for example, "*climate change*" and "*societal breakdown/collapse*") &mdash; and am trying my best to process what I've been researching for the past few years. I most certainly am in the midst of a 'dance' with grief, anger, guilt, confusion, fear, numbness, acceptance, and fleeting moments of&hellip; peace.

[I wrote a post](/writing/2023-05-31/the-climate-crisis-what-to-make-of-it) just over a year ago to at least begin recording my thoughts &mdash; as well as the sources I've been referencing.

I'm also concerned about (and paying attention to) the [geopolitical events playing out in our world](https://theduran.com/orwells-warning-the-insidious-nature-of-political-language-the-cargo-cult-of-woke-christian-parenti-doublespeak-doublethink-history-has-stopped-party-is-always-right/) at the moment. I'm not a '*doomster*' per se but I am a realist, and prefer not to put my head in the sand if I can help it.

It irritated me as a kid when my dad often used to say...

> Observe... observe... observe.

I get it now.
