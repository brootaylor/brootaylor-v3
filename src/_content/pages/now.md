## Learning

Some '*life-skills*' like how to tie a bunch of useful knots &mdash; and making a fire in all weather conditions.

## Hobbies

This is most definitely something I need to work on. I've always had hobbies like [drumming](/photos/2016-11-22/photo_201611222058) and [photography](/photos) over the years but, for some reason, since the Covid *'blip'* I've got myself in a bit of a hole that I'm struggling to get out of.

Hopefully now that Spring's *just* about here, I'll get my camera out and enjoy the outdoors a bit more. ðŸ™‚
