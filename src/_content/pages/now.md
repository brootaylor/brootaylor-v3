summary: "A place to log what I've got on the go right now&hellip;ish. It could be about anything really. Like work related stuff, what I'm reading, listening to, watching, learning, planning, and reflecting on."

lead:
  - It's autumn here in the south east of the UK. The day's are getting shorter and the cold, wind and rain is setting in.
  - I'm already missing the warmth of the sun but there is something to be said <em>(sometimes)</em> about cosy evenings by a fire with a good book or movie.

## Work

I'm still working, on a contract basis, as a **Frontend Engineer** for [Admiral Group Plc](/projects/admiral) on their [customer facing websites](/projects/admiral). It's turned out to be a fab experience working with a great team of people. Some of them I would now call good friends.

## Learning

Trying to create space to give these my attention...

* [JavaScript for Everyone](https://piccalil.li/javascript-for-everyone) <i aria-hidden="true">&rarr;</i> *I've been writing JavaScript for years but when Matt Marquis writes about something I'm there*.
* [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) <i aria-hidden="true">&rarr;</i> *Currently working through Scott Jehl's "[Web Components Demystified](https://scottjehl.com/learn/webcomponentsdemystified/)" course*.
* [Astro](https://astro.build/) <i aria-hidden="true">&rarr;</i> *I'm liking this web framework and that it's focussed on reducing the JavaScript overhead and complexity compared to other frameworks*.

Also brushing up on some of my '*[survival skills](https://youtu.be/BFheNvvJGoQ)*' &mdash; like how to tie a bunch of [useful knots](https://youtu.be/kA48yzKYp3Q) and [fire building techniques](https://youtu.be/7v4twfXG2uY) - in [all weather conditions](https://youtu.be/QiYlEyvDbco) as well.

Growing my own chillies as well. My sons and I are suckers for a bit of the 'ol burn. 🌶️

Oh yes, I wrote some code &mdash; ["Ai" Bot Blocker](/writing/2025-01-05/ai-bot-blocker) &mdash; a few months ago to trick the naughty "Ai" bots from scraping the content on my site. Not sure how successful it's been but it was a fun little project nonetheless.

## Reading

I usually have a few books on the go and switch to whichever suits my fancy at the time. These are the one's I'm reading at the moment&hellip;

* [The Song of Albion](https://www.stephenlawhead.com/the-song-of-albion), *Stephen Lawhead*
* [The Huntress: A Dragon's Blade Story](https://www.michaelrmiller.co.uk/novellas) &mdash; *(Novella)*, *Michael R. Miller*

## Listening <span class="visually-hidden">to this</span> <i aria-hidden="true">&rarr;</i> *Music*

I have a wide taste in music and listen to a lot of different genres &mdash; from classical to metal. I'm a sucker for a strong melody though which is why I often find myself listening to country.

Sleep Token's new album, "[Even in Arcadia](https://open.spotify.com/album/1lS7FeRcSUuIGqyg99UGpj?si=NTCUWee_SwW_yjOaVr5zNg)", dropped a few months ago and I'm still totally hooked. Absolutely gorgeous production.

Charles Kelley's new album, "[Songs For A New Moon](https://open.spotify.com/album/0phabaUgbo3UiTmX78Tqcx?si=cOIrJW8JS3SL-dF7BpwaSg)", puts a smile on my face everytime I listen to it. Melody-tastic country music at its finest.

## Listening <span class="visually-hidden">to these</span> <i aria-hidden="true">&rarr;</i> *Podcasts*

I've been listening to a few podcasts lately. I've listed the ones I find myself returning to the most at the moment.

## Plans

My family and I finally got back to South Africa again in July *(for 3 weeks)* and it turned out to be a special time seeing dear family and friends again after so long.

I'm hoping to get back into drumming this year. I miss it desperately and it's been far too long since I've played. There's a fab music studio nearby called [The Hive Rooms](https://www.thehiverooms.com) that I reckon I'll be checking out soon.

## Reflecting

I think a lot about some of the effects of "[Overshoot](https://howtosavetheworld.ca/2021/09/21/overshoot-where-we-stand-now-guest-post-by-michael-dowd/)" &mdash; (for example, "*climate change*" and "*societal breakdown/collapse*") &mdash; and am trying my best to process what I've been researching for the past few years. I most certainly am in the midst of a 'dance' with grief, anger, guilt, confusion, fear, numbness, acceptance, and fleeting moments of&hellip; peace.

[I wrote a post](/writing/2023-05-31/the-climate-crisis-what-to-make-of-it) just over a year ago to at least begin recording my thoughts &mdash; as well as the sources I've been referencing.

I'm also concerned about (and paying attention to) the [geopolitical events playing out in our world](https://theduran.com/orwells-warning-the-insidious-nature-of-political-language-the-cargo-cult-of-woke-christian-parenti-doublespeak-doublethink-history-has-stopped-party-is-always-right/) at the moment. I'm not a '*doomster*' per se but I am a realist, and prefer not to put my head in the sand if I can help it.

It irritated me as a kid when my dad often used to say...

> Observe... observe... observe.

I get it now.
