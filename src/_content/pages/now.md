## Listening <span class="visually-hidden">to this</span> <i aria-hidden="true">&rarr;</i> *Music*

I have a wide taste in music and listen to a lot of different genres &mdash; from classical to metal. I'm a sucker for a strong melody though which is why I often find myself listening to country.

At the moment Coldplay's latest album "[Moon Music](https://open.spotify.com/album/5SGtrmYbIo0Dsg4kJ4qjM6?si=nJEEnWzcQfOq14pHhqh6nw)" is on repeat. This album seems to be touching something deep within me. In particular the opening song, "[Moon Music](https://open.spotify.com/track/41FNZsY7w7KaTQ2bjxdR6w?si=750832d87c5b49d7)". I can't seem to hold back the tears every time I listen to it.

## Listening <span class="visually-hidden">to these</span> <i aria-hidden="true">&rarr;</i> *Podcasts*

I've been listening to a few podcasts lately. While I don't necessarily agree with everything that's said, these are the ones I find myself listening to the most. There are some gems in there if you're prepared to look for them and keep an open mind.

## Watching

Seems to be a bit of a challenge finding something worth watching on TV these days. There's a fair amount of *'slop'* out there these days that's for sure. That, or I'm way too picky.

Saying that, I watched the [American Primeval](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt24069848/) mini series recently and thought it was put together well. It's gritty, brutal and raw &mdash; which I can I only imagine how it maust have been during the birth of the American West.

I'm also watching [Landman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14186672/) at the moment. It's a bit slow at times but I'm enjoying the acting and am intrigued enough to keep watching.

Then there are a few shows I started watching but ended up getting bored or frustrated with the plot and stopped watching. Oh well... 1st world *problems* eh!

## Plans

My family and and I are hoping to get back to South Africa sometime in 2025. I still have family who live out there and it's been far too long since we've seen them.

---

## Reflecting

I think a lot about some of the effects of "[Overshoot](https://howtosavetheworld.ca/2021/09/21/overshoot-where-we-stand-now-guest-post-by-michael-dowd/)" &mdash; (for example, "*climate change*" and "*societal breakdown/collapse*") &mdash; and am trying my best to process what I've been researching for the past few years. I most certainly am in the midst of a 'dance' with grief, anger, guilt, confusion, fear, numbness, acceptance, and fleeting moments of&hellip; peace.

[I wrote a post](/writing/2023-05-31/the-climate-crisis-what-to-make-of-it) just over a year ago to at least begin recording my thoughts &mdash; as well as the sources I've been referencing.

I'm also concerned about (and paying attention to) the [geopolitical events playing out in our world](https://theduran.com/orwells-warning-the-insidious-nature-of-political-language-the-cargo-cult-of-woke-christian-parenti-doublespeak-doublethink-history-has-stopped-party-is-always-right/) at the moment. I'm not a '*doomster*' per se but I am a realist, and prefer not to put my head in the sand if I can help it.

It irritated me as a kid when my dad often used to say...

> Observe... observe... observe.

I get it now.
