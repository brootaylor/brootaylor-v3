## Work

Right now, I'm working on a contract basis as a **Frontend Engineer** for [Admiral Group Plc](https://www.admiralgroup.co.uk/).

## Reading

I usually have a few books & articles on the go and switch to whichever suits my fancy at the time.

*I always try to include a dose of fantasy in my current [reading list](/reading). Mostly to help 'balance' and process the other reads I've got on the go.* ðŸ˜¬ {.call-out}

* [Veiled Intentions: The Dragon's Blade](https://www.michaelrmiller.co.uk/veiledintentions) &mdash; *(book 2 of 3)*, *Michael R. Miller*
* [How to Live](https://sive.rs/h) &mdash; *Derek Sivers*
* [Breaking Together &mdash; a freedom-loving response to collapse](https://jembendell.com/2023/04/08/breaking-together-a-freedom-loving-response-to-collapse/) &mdash; *Jem Bendell*

---

## Watching

* [Ecology as Theology: Decline as Grace](https://youtu.be/SQYrkhAuJH0) &mdash; *Michael Dowd (Video)*
* [The Tattooist of Auschwitz](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9022422/) &mdash; *TV Series*

---

## Learning

* Tinkering around on a bunch of personal code projects using technologies like [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/), [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/), [Fractal](https://fractal.build/), [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) animation with [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/), [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components), [IndieKit](https://getindiekit.com/) and [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/).
* Brushing up on some of my '*[survival skills](https://youtu.be/BFheNvvJGoQ)*' &mdash; like how to tie a bunch of [useful knots](https://youtu.be/kA48yzKYp3Q) and [fire building techniques](https://youtu.be/7v4twfXG2uY) - in [all weather conditions](https://youtu.be/QiYlEyvDbco) as well.

## Hobbies

This is most definitely something I need to work on. I've always had hobbies like [drumming](/photos/2016-11-22/photo_201611222058) and [photography](/photos) but, for some reason, since the Covid *'blip'* I've got myself in a bit of a hole that I'm struggling to get out of.

Hopefully now that warmer weather is *just* about here, I'll get my camera out and enjoy the outdoors a bit more. ðŸ™‚
