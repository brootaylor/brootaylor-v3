## The work I do

Iâ€™m a front-end web developer, ui engineer/designer and generalist &mdash; *meaning I also do some visual design, back-end, and devops if needs be*.

All things impacting the user experience on the web matters to me. This is where I'm most comfortable and where I've ended up specialising. Which is why you'll mostly find me tinkering around in the "[front-of-the-front-end](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/)" &mdash; the somewhat broad and *fuzzy* intersection between design and back-end engineering.

### Working with design systems

Iâ€™ve had some experience creating frontend solutions to support design systems & design token architecture &mdash; making sure components are consistent, scalable, and themeable &mdash; and donâ€™t tie developers to any one tech stack. Itâ€™s something I really enjoy working on and would like to do more of.  I think a good design system should be a stable foundation &mdash; flexible and tech-agnostic enough to stay relevant and useful, even as technologies come and go.

### Am I a "[full-stack] developer"?

I've resisted calling myself a "[[full-stack] developer](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/full-stack-developers/)" &mdash; regardless of what some of my roles and experience may indicate. I do know how to do full-stack development, not because I've always necessarily wanted to, but <span id="fnref:fullstack" rel="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fullstack" rel="footnote">because I've often *'had'* to <sup>2</sup></a></span>.

I'm quite good at picking up new skills and programming languages, as well as problem solving. I've been fortunate enough to work with some really talented, kind and supportive people over the years, and much of the success I've enjoyed during <span id="fnref:career" rel="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:career" rel="footnote">my career <sup>1</sup></a></span> is thanks to them.

## About this website

This website has been the home of my personal blog for a fair few years. Everything written here represents my opinions and perspectives on various things. It *doesn't* reflect or represent the views of anyone I work for or with.

I also use it as a platform for experimenting with newer frontend web technologies & techniques &mdash; so there's every chance it may look a little 'wonky' now and then. Please forgive me if something doesn't look quite right or work properly on your screen at the moment.

I resonate with Ethan when he says, [let a website be a worry stone](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/). {.call-out}

If you have any issues, questions or spot any spelling mistakes(!), I'd appreciate it if you could let me know by submitting a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/brootaylor/brootaylor-v3/issues), or by [emailing me directly](/contact).

I've also written about my decision to [redesign & develop my website in the open](/writing/2022-02-22/redesigning-in-the-open) which has both been fun and scary. Not least because I'm a bit of a perfectionist and doing it this way has helped wean me off the need to have things completely polished before showing them.

### &ldquo;Ai&rdquo; crawlers and tracking

Even though it's more than likely [too late & doesn't work anyway](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/robots-txt/), I attempted to opt `brootaylor.com` out of its content being used to train AI models. By disallowing known web crawlers used for training AI models in my [<code>robots.txt</code> file](https://brootaylor.com/robots.txt).

I wrote a bit about this initial approach to [opting out of "Ai" crawlers](/writing/2025-01-01/robots-txt) &mdash; but soon realised this wasn't going to work in the slightest. So I decided to try a different approach by [*attempting*] to make it trickier for them to scrape my content.

[I wrote about this](/writing/2025-01-05/ai-bot-blocker) and you're welcome to nick the code and use it on your website if you think it'll work for you.

This all really does feel like a game of whack-a-mole though.

I also added an ["Ai" *'manifesto'* page](/ai) in an attempt to put a stake in the ground &mdash; *(for my website anyhow)* &mdash; and to let folks know that nothing published on this website and on my blog was written by an "Ai".

It's probably worth mentioning that [I don't use any tracking technologies](/privacy#analytics-%26-tracking) &mdash; (*home-grown or third-party*) &mdash; to collect information about what you read or click on this website.
