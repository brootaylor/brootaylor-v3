## What I do

I morph between being called a **Frontend Web Developer** / **Frontend Engineer** / **UI Engineer** / **Design Engineer** these days. But I do miss calling myself a *Web Designer & Developer* as that still makes sense to me.

I specialise in the "[front-of-the-front-end](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/){rel=external}" &mdash; the somewhat broad and *fuzzy* intersection between design and back-end engineering. From time to time, you'll also find me tinkering around in the “*back-of-the-front-end*”.

I'm quite good at picking up new skills and programming languages, as well as problem solving. I've been fortunate enough to work with some really talented, kind and supportive people, and much of the success I've enjoyed during <span id="fnref:career" rel="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:career" rel="footnote">my career <sup>1</sup></a></span> is thanks to them.

I wouldn't call myself a "[full-stack developer](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/full-stack-developers/){rel=external}" per se, regardless of what some of my previous roles may indicate. I know how to do full-stack development, not because I necessarily wanted to, but <span id="fnref:fullstack" rel="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fullstack" rel="footnote">because I've had to <sup>2</sup></a></span>.

Here's a longer read on [who I am personally](/about/me).

## About this website

This website has been the home of my personal blog for a fair few years. Everything written here represents my opinions and perspectives on various things. It *doesn't* reflect or represent the views of anyone I work for or with.

I also use it as a platform for experimenting with newer frontend web technologies & techniques &mdash; so there's every chance it may look a little 'wonky' now and then. Please forgive me if something doesn't look quite right or work properly on your screen at the moment.

I resonate with Ethan when he says, [let a website be a worry stone](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/){rel=external}. {.call-out}

If you have any issues, questions or spot any spelling mistakes(!), I'd appreciate it if you could let me know by submitting a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/brootaylor/brootaylor-v3/issues){rel=external}, or by [emailing me directly](/contact).

I've also written about my decision to [redesign & develop my website in the open](/writing/2022-02-22/redesigning-in-the-open) which has both been fun and scary. Not least because I'm a bit of a perfectionist and doing it this way has helped wean me off the need to have things completely polished before showing them.

### Crawlers & tracking

Even though it's more than likely [too late & doesn't work anyway](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/robots-txt/){rel=external}, I've attempted to opt `brootaylor.com` out of its content being used to train AI models. Known web crawlers used for training AI models are disallowed in my [<code>robots.txt</code> file](https://brootaylor.com/robots.txt).

I've also set up a machine-readable [<code>ai.txt</code> file](https://brootaylor.com/ai.txt), using [Spawning.ai's proposed format](https://site.spawning.ai/spawning-ai-txt){rel=external}. There's no real evidence that it has any traction in the land-of-the-web *yet* &mdash; but I thought why not.

More information about the technology used to make this website is available in this [<code>humans.txt</code> file](https://brootaylor.com/humans.txt).

It's probably worth mentioning that [I don't use any tracking technologies](/privacy#analytics-%26-tracking) &mdash; (*home-grown or third-party*) &mdash; to collect information about what you read or click on this website.
