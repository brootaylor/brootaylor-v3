## Hobbies & other interests

I enjoy [taking photos](/photos), [reading](/reading) and am a [fairly decent drummer](/photos/2022-03-29/photo_202203292358). But, I ended up having to [sell my drumkit](/photos/2022-04-06/photo_202204062304) recently for various reasons. I miss playing *big* time and hope I'll get a chance to play again in the future... ðŸ¤ž

Fly fishing for trout is something I grew up doing and continue to do. I head to the beautiful [Lakedown Trout Fishery](https://www.lakedowntroutfishery.com/){rel=external} now and then. A gorgeous and tranquil spot away from all the noise.

I absolutely adore aircraft and hope that one day I'll be able to either get my PPL or GPL.

I write now and then &ndash; and have [written a few posts](/writing), [jotted down some notes](/notes), and [bookmarked links to articles](/bookmarks) I've enjoyed and found interesting. Hopefully some of them resonate with you.
