lead:
  - This page is <em>kinda</em> like a mini autobiography &mdash; a starter for ten. Somewhere to put down some markers while I try figure out where else to go with it.
  - I plan to add bits and bobs whenever I think of something that's possibly a worthwhile reminder of my life so far.

Before ever touching a computer at the end of the 90's, my life revolved around *â€˜teasingâ€™* cows &mdash; *(on our dairy farm)*. Off-road motorbiking, hiking and wild camping in the mountains, stargazing, canoeing, fishing, photography, drumming, playing a bunch of team and individual sports, training as a chef, and aspiring to be a pilot. {.call-out}

## Other stuff about me

I enjoy [taking photos](/photos), [reading](/reading) and am a [fairly decent drummer](/photos/2016-11-22/photo_201611222058). But, I ended up having to [sell my drumkit](/photos/2022-04-06/photo_202204062304) recently for various reasons. I miss playing  and hope I'll get a chance to play again in the future... ðŸ¤ž

I love cooking from scratch and am especially good at a bunch of one-pan dishes. I like the flow of cooking this way &mdash; and it keeps things less complicated. If there's an open fire involved that's even better! One of my favourites at the moment is a [sausage &amp; squash chilli](https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/sausage-recipes/sausage-squash-chilli/).

Fly fishing for trout is something I grew up doing and continue to do. I head to the beautiful [Lakedown Trout Fishery](https://www.lakedowntroutfishery.com/){rel=external} now and then. A gorgeous and tranquil spot away from all the noise.

I absolutely [adore aircraft](/photos/2022-03-30/photo_202203301354) and hope that one day I'll be able to either get my PPL or GPL.

I write now and then &ndash; and have [written a few posts](/writing), [jotted down some notes](/notes), and [bookmarked links to articles](/bookmarks) I've enjoyed and found interesting. Hopefully some of them resonate with you.

The picture below is my favourite place in the whole world.
