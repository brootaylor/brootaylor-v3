Not that I have anything against "Ai" (aka LLMs) per se &mdash; but I'm not overly enamoured with the idea of using them to write content for my website or blog. I prefer to write everything myself.

I'm also a bit annoyed that "Ai" bots have been gobbling up the internet's content *(my website included)* to train their models. I don't think it's fair that they can do this without asking for permission first.

Like [Jeremy Keith said](https://adactio.com/links/20380):

> Now that the horse has bolted—and ransacked the web—you can shut the barn door.

Anyway, I thought I'd have a go at chucking a fly in the ointment by [*attempting*] to make it trickier for them to scrape my content.

You can read more about [what I've implemented on my website](/writing/2025-01-05/ai-bot-blocker) &mdash; and you're also more than welcome to nick the code and use it on your website if you think it'll work for you.
