I'd [love to hear from you](/contact) if you think I may be able to help out with your next project &mdash; or if you'd just like to connect. ðŸ‘‹ {.call-out}

Even though I've done this web building thing for a while now, I certainly haven't got it all figured out. I'm still learning and I imagine you are as well.

  We got Bruce in to to help us develop a front-end boilerplate / component library as we were inundated with projects and needed a safe pair of hands that could help us achieve quality results with minimal supervision.<br><br>
  Bruce delivered a high-quality framework that ticks all of the boxes for us. And to top it all heâ€™s a great guy to work with, highly professional, he gets on well with everyone and really cares about his work. I would not hesitate to hire Bruce again.
