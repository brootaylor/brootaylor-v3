I particularly enjoy roles and projects that ***strike a balance between user and developer experiences*** &mdash; empowering teams to write great code that aligns with their needs and preferences, while ensuring a positive user experience.

I try my best to build web solutions that are [resilient](https://resilientwebdesign.com/), [usable](https://trentwalton.com/2014/03/10/device-agnostic/) and as future-friendly as possible. For this reason I prefer a vanilla approach and tend to be fairly tech-agnostic.

<div class="call-out | flow">
  <p>Whether you're <em><strong>starting a website from fresh</strong></em> or <em><strong>enhancing an existing one</strong></em>, I'd love to help you establish a lasting and meaningful online presence.</p>
  <p><a href="/contact">Please get in touch</a> if you think I may be able to help out with your next project &mdash; or if you'd just like to connect. ðŸ‘‹</p>
</div>
