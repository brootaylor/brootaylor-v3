  Bruce was incredibly knowledgeable in website design and development, always came up with great solutions, delivered to a high standard with great attention to detail, and was very easy to work with. He was also able to communicate his technical knowledge in a straightforward way to someone who was not from a technical background.<br>
  I would highly recommend Bruce to any organisation.
