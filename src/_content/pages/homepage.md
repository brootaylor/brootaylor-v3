    <p>I worked with Bruce for many years at Avios, both within the same team and across projects. Bruce was incredibly knowledgeable in website design and development, always came up with great solutions, delivered to a high standard with great attention to detail, and was very easy to work with.</p>
    <p>He was also able to communicate his technical knowledge in a straightforward way to someone who was not from a technical background. I would highly recommend Bruce to any organisation.</p>
